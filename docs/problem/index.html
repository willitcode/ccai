AI servers are stored in data centers that produce massive amounts of electronic waste, which contains mercury and lead, both extremely toxic and dangerous substances.</p>
<p>To function and maintain optimal temperature, these data centers use water to help. However, these data centers are consuming far more water than is available, especially when roughly 2 billion people in the world do not have access to clean drinking water.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> In 2022, Microsoft’s environmental report showed that its water consumption had jumped to 34% since 2021, using nearly 1.7 billion gallons of water.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Google reported using 5.5 billion gallons of water during that same time.<sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>On top of producing electronic waste and consuming far too much water, AI servers also require lots of raw materials to be built. These materials are usually mined unsustainably and in environmentally destructive ways.</p>
<p>However, AI has its benefits. It will likely play a role in solving the climate crisis or at least helping find temporary solutions. AI’s pattern recognition will help play a crucial role in tracking changing weather patterns and rising sea levels.</p>
