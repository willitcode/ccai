As big tech companies across the world turn their focus to the power of AI, the number of resource-intensive data centers needed to support the growing industry only increases.[^1] Because data centers require so much electricity, companies constructing data centers often choose areas with cheap, instead of renewable, energy sources meaning that they rely on coal or oil burning power plants which have massive carbon footprints.[^2] New data centers can often delay the closing of these carbon-producing power plants, or even prompt the construction of new ones to provide the necessary electricity, pumping out more carbon into the atmosphere, continuing to warm the planet and provoke extreme weather events. 

With the increase in focus on renewable energy and carbon emissions, one of the biggest problems with artificial intelligence slips under the radar: the water required to cool the servers in the data centers. A cycle of high consumption and low recycling creates a deficit that is usually addressed by simply pulling in more water from other sources, draining the surroundings of a much-needed resource.[^3] [Data centers are often built in locations with cheap real estate and energy, leading to a worsening of the area’s water stress as water is redirected into cooling the massive data centers.](/causes)[^4] 

Overall, the environmental impact presented by data centers across the world contribute to preexisting geographic inequalities. Because of the choices made in the construction of data centers, the negative impacts such as the pollution produced in the process of producing the necessary power and the contamination of the [water used in the cooling process](/problem) are often shouldered by less fortunate countries and people. Freshwater makes up only 3% of our water supply, 2.5% of which is locked in frozen tundras and glaciers. With only 0.5% of our world’s water supply available for human consumption,[^4] a water guzzling industry such as Artificial Intelligence is simply not sustainable. While carbon and greenhouse gasses are the focus of much criticism and vigilance in a newer, more environmentally conscious society, it is vital that we acknowledge the massive impacts of excessive water use and turn our eyes towards its effects as well.
