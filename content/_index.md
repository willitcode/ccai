We believe in the future of AI, and we're pushing to make it more eco-friendly. Currently, AI has huge environmental effects through its water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and the mining of silicon and other raw materials. Our work revolves around trying to reduce those emissions while still allowing for the incredible potential of AI's contributions to global environmental preservation efforts.
