We believe in the future of AI, and we're pushing to make it more eco-friendly. Currently, AI has huge environmental effects through its water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and the mining of silicon and other raw materials. Our work revolves around trying to reduce those emissions while still allowing for the incredible potential of AI's contributions to global environmental preservation efforts.

# THE PROBLEM
AI poses a massive threat to our environment. It consumes enormous amounts of resources in the form of water and raw materials, and it creates huge amounts of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. [Read more about the problem...](/problem)

# THE CAUSES
This is caused in large part by "data colonialism," a form of neocolonialism where companies like Google and Microsoft export their polluting, over-consuming AI datacenters to poorer, formerly colonized nations. [Read more about the causes...](/causes)

# THE IMPACTS
This has huge impacts on the environment, and data colonialism means those impacts are felt the most by people who are already underprivileged. The water resources of already drought-stricken countries like Uruguay are being drained by shiny new AI data centers, for example. [Read more about the impacts...](/impacts)

# OUR SOLUTIONS
CCAI is working hard to combat the environmental impacts writ large of AI and data colonialism. We're funding research, working directly with smaller local organizations, and educating folks on this situation. [Read more about our solutions...](/solutions)
